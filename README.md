# Resignation Intention Final Project
## ðŸ“ŠGoal
Explore and analyze the data, and then create machine learning models that could assist the company in making better data-driven decisions. Specifically, the dataset we were given for our project pertained to employees' intentions to resign from a company.

## ðŸ“‘Tasks
Our project tasks included:
1. Visualizing the characteristics of employees who were considering resigning
2. Determining whether receiving a promotion affected an employee's likelihood to resign
3. Identifying which department had the most loyal employees
4. Analyzing the correlations among all the attributes in the dataset
5. Developing machine learning models to predict an employee's likelihood to resign and the length of time they would remain with the company
6. Examining and visualizing clusters within the dataset.
